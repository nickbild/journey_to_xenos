# Journey to Xenos

A homebrew Atari 2600 game.

```
Red alert! It's the year 2115 and the inhabitants of the planet Xenos have invaded Earth! 

As the Earth's greatest fighter pilot, and last hope, you must lead a squadron of Novus class 3 fighter ships to the planet Xenos. A new fusion bomb has been developed that can end the war and save the Earth, but it must be delivered from close range. Can you beat all the odds and save the Earth? 

Quickly, Captain, to your ship!
```

In the grand Atari tradition of presenting exciting cover artwork and gripping storylines that give way to giant pixel blobs and mediocre gameplay after the cartridge is clicked in, I present you with Journey to Xenos!

You can fly your blob--Ahem!--Novus class 3 fighter ship around the planet Xenos, and when you reach the industrial targets down below, drop your bombs with the fire button. But watch out! The Xenotians are fighting back with a hail of anti-aircraft missiles. To help avoid the missiles you'll need to fly fast, really fast, which will make bombing accuracy difficult.
