# Journey to Xenos

A homebrew Atari 2600 game.

```
Red alert! It's the year 2115 and the inhabitants of the planet Xenos have invaded Earth! 

As the Earth's greatest fighter pilot, and last hope, you must lead a squadron of Novus class 3 fighter ships to the planet Xenos. A new fusion bomb has been developed that can end the war and save the Earth, but it must be delivered from close range. Can you beat all the odds and save the Earth? 

Quickly, Captain, to your ship!
